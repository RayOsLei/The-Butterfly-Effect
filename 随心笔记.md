## My Butterfly Effect

```tex
In 2007, A hurt me. At that age, I couldn't forgive him. I was always worried, and I brought a heavy burden to myself, so that my heart would always be lingering. . . Bull shit, B, also came to hurt me, I was going crazy, I planed whether to put a string of small firecrackers worthy of fifty cents in A's armor or to send B to the hospital. I really thought so much, no When I planned, I re-planned that the two hateful guys, C and D, should taste some sweetness... Then I found a cousin who was very similar to me, to help me plan it, I had already mentioned to him who was damn, C should be taken off his pants by a bunch of girls , D, you help me to bash him. Jesus, he actually ridiculed me, you didn't hurt other people? who also wanted to take off your pants in front of the girl's face and kicked you off. I feeled shame that I didn't have such a cousin. I meight have dropped the door and slammed it...Time went to 2009, I woke up. I went to the Mengliang hillside where I used to go. I didn’t go to the top of the mountain, I thought that the world is so bad, When you woke up someday, you had been hurt by more than one people, and even more hateful that Who hurt you, you tm had forgotten it. But occasionally remember a few people, you did not know whether they were good or bad, if you gave them more damage, then they would not hurt you. I also thought about my cousin's stinking advice, but after all, it was unhappy... Time back to 2007, I found S, a good buddy planning to give A a lesson on the way to school. We were all immersed in a trap designed specifically for A. When he came over, I had already pinched my left fist, and patted S , saying go! I suddenly felt that I was kicked and hit the wall. I fainted...A fell to the ground, S changed to B, He kicked me, no, A blocked me, I wasn’t kicked, what happened to them, these two strange guys left me smiling.... Later, I went to find my cousin. His family was in a supermarket close to the elementary school not far away. When I first entered, someone called my name, my mother, how was she here? Where was my cousin? I need his help. My mother said that she would cook for me, then she went straight to the kitchen. I turned the house over and over to find my cousin, Where is my cousin? The Bible in my hand was thrown out, I didn’t know where to drop a family photo, there were grandmother, father, mother, brother, and me, but no cousin... In the late fall of 15th, I was lying in bed reading the Bible. The pages of the book turn to the New Testament, 1 Corinthians 13:4-8:
Love is enduring patience and kindness. Love is not awkward, love is not boastful, not arrogant, not doing shy things, not asking for your own benefits, not easily anger, not counting human evil, not like unrighteousness, only like the truth; everything is tolerant, everything believes, Look forward to everything, be patient with everything. Love is never stop... So sleepy, how was this 6:30... I I didn’t brush my teeth and didn’t wash my face, I still turned on the computer, stood up to the balcony, opened the window, the soft wind rushed, I stretched my waist, rubbed my eyes, looked at the excavator in the future pedestrian street, and then prepared to open the D drive to see a few films. What happened? What about my film? So depressed, actually nothing was there, I refreshed it, wow, so horrible, all forbidden films, absolutely horrible. . . I was refreshed to watch a chainsaw, but I had no feelings. I was patient and open the second part,  I wanted to spit it when I seen half of it with no feeling of horror. Oh, it’s so sleepy... Hey, it was Peter, our psychology teacher, listen: It’s normal to had annoying people at this age, but it’s best to hide it in your heart, not too high-profile. If you thought of his bad, go into the horror movie. When you graduated, you would compress all the horror movies you watched and upload them to Baidu Cloud Disk and send them to him. Tell him how bad he was, how much you hate him. Do not believed that he was not moved, such a rich resource. This idea was very good. When I saw the second part, I didn't hate him...
When I suddenly remembered something, I woke up. At 11 o'clock, I packed up and went to eat.
